# Project: Recipe Recommendation System

This repository contains a project for a Recipe Recommendation System developed during my internship. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to recommend recipes based on user preferences and dietary restrictions.

### Project Overview

The Recipe Recommendation System performs the following tasks:

1. Dataset Collection: Gathered a dataset containing recipes, ingredients, and user ratings.
2. Data Preprocessing: Processed and extracted relevant features from the dataset.
3. Recommendation System: Implemented a recommendation system using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a combination of both.
4. Performance Evaluation: Assessed the system's accuracy and precision.

### Additional Challenge

- Developed a hybrid recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
- Addressed the cold-start problem for new users and new recipes.

### Folder Structure

- `Task_01/`: Contains all the files related to the project.
  - `.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the machine learning model.
  - `.py`: Python files for backend functionality using Flask.
  - `html/`: HTML files for the frontend.
  - `css/`: CSS files for styling the frontend.
  - `js/`: JavaScript files for frontend interactivity.
  - `dataset/`: The dataset used for training and testing the recommendation system.

### Requirements

- Python: For running the `.py` and `.ipynb` files.
- Flask: For the backend.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the frontend.
