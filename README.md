# Project: Recipe Recommendation System

This repository contains a project for a Recipe Recommendation System. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to recommend recipes based on user preferences and dietary restrictions.

### Project Overview

The Recipe Recommendation System performs the following tasks:

1. Dataset Collection: Gathered a dataset containing recipes, ingredients, and user ratings.
2. Data Preprocessing: Processed and extracted relevant features from the dataset.
3. Recommendation System: Implemented a recommendation system using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a combination of both.
4. Performance Evaluation: Assessed the system's accuracy and precision.

### Additional Challenge

- Developed a hybrid recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
- Addressed the cold-start problem for new users and new recipes.
